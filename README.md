# âœ¨ Spicetify Config
Here is my config for [spicetify](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli) a CLI to customize Spotify with Themes and Extensions.

## ðŸŽ¨ Theme
I'm using the [Onepunch](https://github.com/morpheusthewhite/spicetify-themes/tree/master/Onepunch) theme with my custom modifications to have a color palette like the [CherryBlossom](https://github.com/morpheusthewhite/spicetify-themes/tree/master/CherryBlossom) coral theme.

- [Onepunch with custom colors](./themes/Onepunch)

## ðŸ”§ Extensions
- [Bookmark](./extensions/bookmark.js)
	> Easily store and browse pages, play tracks or tracks in specific time. Useful for who wants to check out an artist, album later without following them or writing their name down.

- [Full App Display](./extensions/fullAppDisplay.js)
	> Full App Display: Minimal album cover art display with beautiful blur effect background. Activating button locates in top bar. While in display mode, double click anywhere to exit. Right click anywhere to open setting menu.
	
- [Queue All](./extensions/queueAll.js)
	> You like using Discover, New Releases page to find new music but adding each one of them to queue takes a lot of effort? If so, activate this extensions and apply. At top of every carousel now has a "Queue All" button to help you add all of them to queue. Note: Not available for playlist carousels. Just songs, albums ones.
	
- [Shuffle+](./extensions/shuffle+.js)
	> Detect current context (playlist, album, user collection or show), gather all its items and shuffle them with Fisherâ€“Yates algorithm. After injecting this extension, go to Queue and you can find 2 new buttons at page header: - Shuffle Context: detect current context and shuffle all its item. - Shuffle Queue: shuffle only 80 items or less that are visible in Queue page. It's only useful for mixed context queue. For most of the time, just use Shuffle Context.
